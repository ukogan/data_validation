=====================================

STEP 1: Load Your Building Data
Title: 📊 Step 1: Load Your Building Data
Content: Look for the green button highlighted below that says '📊 Latest from Database'. This is your starting point!

Click this button to load live sensor data from your TimescaleDB.

The button is highlighted with a pulsing purple border.

STEP 2: Understanding Key Metrics
Title: 📊 Step 2: Understanding Key Metrics
Content: After loading data, you'll see this executive summary highlighted below. Let me explain what each metric means:

📊 Standby Mode = Percentage of time zones are in energy-saving mode
🌬️ Airflow Reduction = Reduction in airflow when spaces are unoccupied (leads to energy savings)
🔗 Correlation Health = How well sensors and BMS work together

📡 Data Completeness: We expect sensor data 2× per minute and BMS data 1× per minute. Missing data affects analysis accuracy.

The highlighted section shows your building's overall performance.

STEP 3: Floor Organization
Title: 🏢 Step 3: Floor Organization
Content: Sensors are automatically grouped by floor (e.g., Floor 1, Floor 2, Floor 3). Each floor shows:

📊 Standby % = Percentage of time floor zones are in energy-saving mode
⚠️ Out of Spec % = Percentage of timing violations across all floor rooms

💡 Compare floors: Identify if issues are building-wide or isolated to specific floors. The highlighted floor below shows example metrics.

STEP 4: Room-Level Performance
Title: 🏠 Step 4: Room-Level Performance
Content: Click the ^ expand button on the left of any floor to see individual room metrics. Each room shows:

← occupied | standby → = Fraction of time sensor vs BMS show each mode. When these figures differ significantly, the system isn't responding properly and bars turn yellow/red.

Missing Data = Gaps in sensor/BMS communication
Last Outage = Most recent data interruption
Commissioning Table = Deviation counts showing timing violations:
• Early: Zone responds before minimum time
• Late: Zone delays response beyond maximum time
• Standby/Occupied: Transitions to/from each mode
24hr Chart = Visual timeline of occupancy vs BMS response

💡 Color coding: Green = working well, Yellow/Red = needs attention

---

STEP 5: Time Controls
Title: ⏰ Step 5: Time Controls
Content: Use these time period buttons to analyze different ranges:

📅 Latest 24 Hrs = Recent rolling window
📊 5 Days = Short-term trend analysis
📈 30 Days = Long-term performance patterns

The highlighted controls let you switch between different analysis timeframes.

---

STEP 6: Timeline View
Title: 📈 Step 6: Timeline View
Content: Click the ^ expand button on the left of any room to see a detailed timeline visualization.

⚫ Dark Gray blocks = Sensor detects occupancy
🟢 Green blocks = Sensor unoccupied/zone standby
🔘 Gray blocks = Zone occupied

💡 Perfect alignment = good performance
⚠️ Misaligned timing = violations needing attention

💡 You're now ready to analyze your building's performance!
